    """
    Ingests and processes product data through raw, stage, and production layers in a SQL Server database.

    This function performs the following operations:
    1. Truncates the [raw].[Products] table to remove any existing data.
    2. Inserts the provided product data from the DataFrame into the [raw].[Products] table 
       using the [raw].[IngestRawProducts] stored procedure.
    3. Processes the raw data into the [stage].[Products] table by calling [stage].[ProcessRawProducts].
    4. Upserts staged data into the [prod].[Products] dimension using [prod].[UpsertProductsDim].

    All actions are logged, and exceptions are caught and logged as well. If any error occurs, the transaction is rolled back.

    Parameters:
        connection (pyodbc.Connection): An open pyodbc connection to the SQL Server database.
        cursor (pyodbc.Cursor): A database cursor used to execute SQL statements.
        data (pd.DataFrame): A pandas DataFrame containing the product records with the following columns:
            - name
            - description
            - color
            - brand
            - category
            - gender
